Snake, but with a literal twist.

Use the left and right arrow keys, W and D, or the arrow buttons on a touchscreen to turn your snake. Touch the apples with your head to eat them, increasing your score and the snake's length. If your head runs into a wall or yourself, you lose. Try to get a new highscore!
