Snake, but with a literal twist.

Use the left and right arrow keys or W and D to turn your snake (or the arrow buttons on a touchscreen). Touch the apples with your head to eat them, increasing your score and the snake's length. If your head runs into a wall or yourself, you lose. Try to get a new highscore!
